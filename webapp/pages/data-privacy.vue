            other things, to collect video statistics, to improve user-friendliness and to prevent
            abusive practices. If you are logged in to Google, your information will be directly
            associated with your account when you click on a video. If you do not wish to be
            associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button.
            Google saves your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and
            evaluates them. Such an evaluation takes place in particular according to art. 6 para. 1
            lit.f GDPR on the basis of the legitimate interests of Google in the insertion of
            personalised advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website.
            You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must
            contact YouTube to exercise this right.

          <strong>Use of Google AdWords conversion tracking</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            This website uses the online advertising program 'Google AdWords' and in the context of
            Google AdWords the conversion tracking of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
            Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ('Google').
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            We use the offer of Google Adwords to draw attention to our offers with the help of
            advertising materials (so-called Google Adwords) on external websites. We can determine
            in relation to the data of the advertising campaigns how successful the individual
            advertising measures are. We are interested in showing you advertisements that are of
            interest to you, to make our website more interesting for you and to achieve a fair
            calculation of advertising costs.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an AdWords ad served by
            Google. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer system. These
            cookies usually expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If
            the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google
            and we can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this
            page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore
            be traced through the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the
            conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who
            have opted for conversion tracking. Customers see the total number of users who clicked
            on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, you
            will not receive any information that personally identifies users. If you do not wish to
            participate in tracking, you can block this use by deactivating the Google Conversion
            Tracking cookie via your Internet browser under User Settings. They are then not
            included in the conversion tracking statistics. We use Google Adwords because of our
            legitimate interest in targeted advertising in accordance with art. 6, para. 1, lit. f
            GDPR.
